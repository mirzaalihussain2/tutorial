Welcome to my _new blog_ about being a techie! I'll be documenting my journey here.

## My initial blog posts will cover

1. **Running sprints**: Using Notion to write tickets and organise sprints for a small smartup.
2. **Lessons learnt from losing weight**: less than a year in, Aug 2023
3. **Why I'm starting something now**: I've been wanting to this for a while, now I finally am.

## What's next
Writing more blog posts
